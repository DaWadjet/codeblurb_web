# University Thesis Project - CodeBlurb Web

## Developing a Multiplatform Software Engineer Interview Preparation Platform With Flutter And React

This repository hosts the web client implementation of my Master's thesis at BME-VIK. The thesis documentation is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

The mobile client's code is also accessible under [codeblurb_mobile](https://github.com/DaWadjet/codeblurb_mobile).

This application - at least at the time of writing - is accessible at https://codeblurb-492f1.web.app/

## Core packages

- [React](https://react.dev/) & [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) along with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for rapid UI development
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for async state management, almost covering all my state management needs when combined with custom hooks
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/), [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) and [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer#readme) for everything else, but could be simplified
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for E2E testing
- [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/) for fancy components
